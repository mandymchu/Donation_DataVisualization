## Donation_DataVisualization
In this project, a dataset from DonorsChoose.org is used to build an interactive data visualization that represents school donations broken down by different attributes.

MongoDB, Python, JavaScript, Flask, D3.js, DC.js will be used.

Current problem:
On the page http://localhost:5000/donorschoose/projects projects data could be printed out. However, on the page http://localhost:5000/, only could see a dashboard with empty charts. The problem should be in the amount of data being loaded. Still trying to find its solution.
